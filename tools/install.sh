Done. Next:
  1. Start Besiege and enable "Return 2 Center" in the mods menu.
  2. The two blocks appear in the block menu; search "R2C".
  3. Each has a Mode option in its mapper: R2C returns to centre when you let
     go, S2S sweeps between the limits, Normal holds the angle. The Toggle
     switch turns hold-to-steer into press-once-to-steer.

Note: the game writes the generated mod ID into Mod.xml the first time it loads
the mod. With a symlink that write lands in your working copy, which is what you
want -- <ID> is meant to stay stable for the life of the mod, so commit it.
